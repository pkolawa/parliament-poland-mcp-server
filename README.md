# KRS Poland MCP Server

An MCP server for the Polish National Court Register (KRS) public API.

## Usage

This server is designed to be run with `npx`, allowing you to use it as a tool provider for LLM clients without a global installation.

### Running with `npx`

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npx krs-poland-mcp-server
```

### Configuration for LLM Clients

To integrate this server with an LLM client (like LM Studio or others that support MCP), you can configure it to spawn the server process. Here is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "krs-poland-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "krs-poland-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration tells the client how to start the KRS tool server.

## Development

To run the server in a development environment:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Build the project: `npm run build`
4.  Run the server: `npm start`
